# Credit Card Client Default Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates patterns and predictors of credit card client defaults using advanced data analysis techniques. By exploring the provided dataset, the analysis aims to identify key factors influencing default behavior and provide actionable insights for financial institutions.

## Key Features
- **Dataset Exploration:** Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of machine learning algorithms to classify client defaults.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying critical factors contributing to defaults.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Addressing potential biases and privacy concerns.

## Datasets
- **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset**
  - Contains records of client demographics, financial behaviors, and default status.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and relationships in the dataset.
- Model Training: Building and evaluating models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Performance Metrics: ROC-AUC, F1 Score, and Precision-Recall curves.
